# Schedule_generator
My goal is to create a script that will generate a schedule for a school, where each class will have designated a propiate teacher and classroom

down the pipeline I would like to implement wishes for the teachers fx. 'I would like to have wednesday afternoons off, so I can drive my kid to badminton'
I would also like to implement rules that says that no teacher (or class) can have purely afternoon or morning classes.
